# Hello Toast World
All about Hello Toast
This is an application which uses three views. Two of them are BUTTON where as one of them is a TEXTVIEW. 
Two buttons have their own unique purpose, the "COUNT" button increments a counter value which is then displayed inside the TextView.
Similalry the "TOAST" button displays a Toast message on the current activity for a short period of time.


The following screenshot shows the design for the current application where a TEXTVIEW of Yellow color is sandwiched between BUTTON. Also it shows a toast message on the bottom of the screen.

Similalry, when the COUNT button is pressed the incremented value is seen in the TEXTVIEW as shown in the screenshot below.

The appication has been well constructed such that when the screen is rotated the position of each view is well adjusted

The following screenshot shows that the TOAST Button is still working even if the layout is changed

Similarly, the COUNT button is also working fine

Likewise, when the orientation of the screen is changed then it automatically adjusts itself
