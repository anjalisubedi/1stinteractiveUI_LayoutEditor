# Hello Toast Constraint
Here the code of hello toast challange is used and tweaked by first changing the color and then adding a thrid button which is intially disabled 
when no increment is done. Howevere, once the COUNT button is clicked and the incrementation starts then the button is enabled. The purpose of the
ZERO button is to restart the count value to 0.

As shown in the figure below the color of the buttons has been changed and a extra button is added which is initally disabled

Similarly, after the count value is incremented then the button is enabled whose purpose is to reset the count value. As shown in the figure the 
button color was grey which indicates that it is disabled and as the incrementation process starts it takes its original color that is purple
